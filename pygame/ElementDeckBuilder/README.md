# ElementDeckBuilder
This is a game that relies on Python3 and the Pygame library.
Inspired by Luck Be A Landlord and Doodle God/Little Alchemists, it revolves around the idea of adjacent elements in a grid reacting to form new elements as well as providing adjacency bonuses.
The game ends when you are unable to pay off the ever-increasing payments each cycle.
